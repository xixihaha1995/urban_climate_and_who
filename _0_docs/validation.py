excerpt 1, commercial building is more easily affected by UHI than residential building.

UHI effect on commercial buildings (i.e. office buildings) and concludes
 that these buildings are less affected than residential buildings by this phenomenon
 because their energy performance is usually dominated by internal heat gains.

excerpt 2, motivation for BUBBLE project.

The meteorological part for air pollution model, are generally developed for surfaces of lesser roughness 
and do not take into account the dispersion conditions in the layer near the surface (Rotach, 2001).

most likely due to the mentioned lack of suitable near-surface information.

Sites introduction

Large city map: https://www.mcr.unibas.ch/dolueg2/projects/campaigns/BUBBLE/images/maps/map_bubble_big.gif.

These sites were equipped with towers reaching from street level up to 2 to 2.5 times the mean building height zH.

The building type is based on the mid rise apartments, but not exactly the same.

3D morphometric parameters of Basel-Sperrstrasse for a circle of 250 m around the tower 
site and the physical properties of urban elements used in the model.

BEM has satisfactorily passed different evaluation processes, including 
testing its modelling assumptions, 
verifying that the chosen equations are solved correctly, and 
validating the model with field data.

Detailed Model vs Simplified Model

The building height, verticalto-horizontal building area ratio, roof-to-horizontal building area ratio, 
glazing ratio, construction configuration of the enclosure (materials and layers), total internal heat gains, 
and infiltration air flowrate are the same as the DM (Table 1).

It resolves the surface boundary layer (SBL) inside and above urban canopy by including a drag force approach
 to account for the vertical effects of buildings as is done in Martilliâ€™s parameterization except that 
 only one surface energy balance per wall is resolved.

It looks like as for the meterological related simulation verification/validation,
canyon temperature, specific humidity, wind speed,
energy balance should be enough.

The critical point is why they choose the above parameters to be the verification/validation parameters.
